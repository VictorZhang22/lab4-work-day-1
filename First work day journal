First entry (16/12/2020 2:30pm – 3:40pm (75 minutes)):
So today I chose the first link because I am more interested in mathematical problems than biological problems. The first problem, which is to add together all the numbers that are either multiples of 3 or 5 under 1000, was simple. The biggest roadblock I experienced was to add numbers together. I was able to make python iterate from 0 – 1000 using a for loop, and I was able to make it calculate which of the numbers are multiples of 3 or 5. But I just could not figure out how to add them together. Then I added an integer (0) at the beginning of the function and added all the eligible numbers to that integer and fixed the issue. 

The second problem was much harder as I spent a long time trying to figure out how I would turn the logic of the Fibonacci sequence into Python code. So, I thought that I would start off with 2 integers, one representing the current number in the sequence and the other the previous one. And then I decided to start small, setting the sequence to no larger than 40. Then I used an if statement to select the even numbers from the sequence. After that, I had to advance in the sequence. But I had a hard time figuring out how as I got myself confused because there were two integers. At last, I figured out that the current number should add the previous number to become the new number, and the previous number should be the current number minus the previous number. 

It took me a while to figure out the logic to the third one because I did not know how to find the prime factors of a number in Python. I will do some research and solve this problem the next time I work on lab4.

I think that the three questions aren’t that challenging, and I definitely enjoyed coding to solve them. I also look forward to solving problems that involve classes and dictionaries.
